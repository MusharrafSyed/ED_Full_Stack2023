    <h2>Little bit about the Full Stack Web Developmenet</h2>
    <p>The second subject is a web development framework made up of MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Nodejs. It is one
        of the several variants of the MEAN stack, with MERN replacing Angular.js with React.js [3]. The MERN stack is a
        popular choice for web developers looking to move quickly, particularly for those with React.js experience. It
        is ideally suited for cases that are JSON-heavy, cloud-native, and that have dynamic web interfaces [2]. The
        MERN stack is designed to make the development process smoother and easier, comprising of four technologies:
        MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js [4]. MERN adheres to a 3-tier architecture system consisting of 3 layers:
        front-end tier for the web, middle tier for the server, and backend tier as the database [9]. There are
        variations to the MEAN stack, such as MEVN (using Vue.js) and MERN+GraphQL (using GraphQL) [7].
